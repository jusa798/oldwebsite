            This graph may be a bit misleading. Seems like I am a beast with Wu Shang! Not true (He's
            probably one of my worst legends).
            When I pulled my data from the Brawlhalla API, I filtered the JSON with characters only 
            above level 5, and he's only at level 6. I suppose I did well the rounds I played with him, but if 
            I continued to play him I am sure the kill / death ratio would move closer to one or even be lower than one.

                Ignoring the outlier, Wu Shang, this damage ratio chart shows one very interesting thing, 
                <strong>Xull</strong>. 
                If you look at the K/D and Win Ratio charts (0.79 and 0.39 respectively) 
                you will see that I am a terrible Xull. However, Xull's attack power is the highest in the game,
                which is why I do more damage than I take. Even though I die and lose more, I still do tons of damage!
                Maybe the key to diamond is learning to play a little more defensively with Xull...

                The way ELO works, most people will find themselves hovering around a certain ranking,
                and as they gradually get better, their average rank will gradually increase. I had two massive jumps
                in ELO. The first in Silver from 1100 to 1400 after I learned Hattori's specials (win rate of 52%). 
                The next jump was with Teros, when I went from 1450-1650 in practically a day after I realized I liked
                axe a lot (also a win rate of 52%).

                A straightforward graph. Hattori is my most played legend, but Teros is catching up. I also have the
                black Hattori skin which makes me want to play her more. I'll also play some more Wu Shang which will definitely
                drive down his K/D and Win ratios.
